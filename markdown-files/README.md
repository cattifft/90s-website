Personal Portfolio Website - Basic HTML
---

**Objective**:

Build a personal portfolio website to showcase your skills, hobbies, or anything else you'd like to present. The website should be a reflection of you, so make sure to add your personal touch.

---

**Requirements**:

1. **Unique Theme**: Your website should have a theme that is individual to you. For example, if you love gardening, you could create a garden-themed website.

2. **Web Pages**: Create at least five HTML pages, where one page is in a file named `index.html`. Some pages should be placed inside directories for logical organization. For example:
    - **A "projects" directory**: If you are showcasing multiple projects, create a directory to house each project page.
    - **A "gallery" directory**: If you are including a collection of photos or images, create a separate directory for gallery-related pages.
    - Ensure the directory structure makes sense based on your theme and purpose.

    The five required pages should include:
    - Home Page (`index.html`)
        - Include whatever you want here, be creative! Some ideas include your name, art that you have made, links to websites that you like, collections of information that you care about (quotes, books, sports stats, video games...?).
    - About Me Page
        - Include a description, a photo, a list of skills/hobbies, and anything else you want.
    - Contact Page
        - This page should include a form with which visitors can contact you. On submit, this form should open the user's email client and auto-fill an email using the form data.
    - Additional Pages
        - At least two other pages that relate to your theme (e.g., a Projects page, a Gallery page, a Blog page, etc.).

3. **Images and Colors**: Your website should include at least 10 images and at least 5 different HTML colors. Please make sure that your image filesizes are not too large (no image should be < 1 MB).

4. **Content Types**: Use at least five different specialized-content (i.e., not pure text) HTML elements (e.g., images, lists, links, tables, forms, embeds, etc.).

5. **Accessibility**: Your entire site should implement best practices for accessibility, including alt text for images and metadata.

6. **Code Comments**: Each HTML file should include comments, even if they're only for fun.

7. **Old-Style HTML Only**: Use only HTML for this assignment. Do not include CSS or JavaScript. The focus is on practicing basic HTML structure and content creation.

**Submission Instructions**:

1. Include all `.html` files in your git repository.
2. In a file called `reflection.md`, write a few sentences or paragraphs of reflection explaining your development process, the difficulties you faced, and how you solved them.
3. Upload your final working site to your CS Unix account:
    - Use the SSH address `linux.cs.du.edu`.
    - Your site should be placed in the `public_html` folder in your home directory.
    - Once uploaded, your site should be accessible at `http://cs.du.edu/~yourusername/page.html`.
    - If you have not received an email with setup instructions for your account, you may already have one. Contact Andrei Roudik at `andrei.roudik@du.edu` for assistance with forgotten usernames or passwords.
    - You can use any method (e.g., SSH, SCP) to upload your files.

**Assessment**:

1. Your submitted code will be reviewed for its uniqueness, complexity, and alignment with the assignment requirements.
2. You may be called upon to explain your code and the decisions you made while creating your website.
