Project for Intro to Web Programming I at the University of Denver, completed in January of 2025.

This project contains two versions of a 90s style website. The top level index.html takes you to a site done entirely in HTML. Under the folder "responsive" is a more modern
version with CSS and JS. The first version was done to explore the history of web design and the challenge of creating an appealing website with limited tools.
The second version was done to learn how responsive web design works and to practice CSS.
